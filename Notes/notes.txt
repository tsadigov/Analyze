 A Unit of Work (184) keeps track of all objects read from the database, together with all objects modified in any way. 
It also handles how updates are made to the database. Instead of the application programmer invoking explicit save methods, the programmer tells the unit of work to commit. 
That unit of work then sequences all of the appropriate behavior to the database, putting all of the complex commit processing in one place. 
Unit of Work (184) is an essential pattern whenever the behavioral interactions with the database become awkward.



Without a Unit of Work (184), typically the domain layer acts as the controller; 
deciding when to read and write to the database. The Unit of Work (184) results from factoring the database mapping controller behavior into its own object.
